        <h2>How to use these pages</h2>
        The run pages are built around a table of each of the frequency bands that are run on and an image showing the output spectrograms and viterbi tracks along with other information.
    
        To filter which frequency bands to use the box to the top left gives a set of options

        <img style="width:30%;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;display:block" src="https://git.ligo.org/joseph.bayley/soapcw/-/raw/master/pipeline/images/options.png" />
        <ul>
        <li> In the first box one can sort the table based on one of the selected headings in ascending or descending order. </li>
        <li> In the second box there is a choice of a number of variables, checking these will include them in the table. </li>
        <li> The third box filters the frequency ranges, input the ranges and clikc filter to change the frequency range </li>
        <li> The fourth box has two buttons (last page, next page), these move between the table pages forwards and backwards </li>
        <ul>

        <img style="width:30%;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;display:block" src="https://git.ligo.org/joseph.bayley/soapcw/-/raw/master/pipeline/images/table.png" />

        The table then shows a list of different frequency bands defined by the fmin and fmax.
        By default it shows the lineaware stat, which is the line aware statistic output from the SOAP search, and the info column. 
        The info column contains extra information about which is known about that band, i.e. info from line investigations or hw injections

        By clicking on one of these cells it shows a plot and a table containing all of the information about this band.
        The table of information looks like this:

        <img style="width:100%;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;display:block" src="https://git.ligo.org/joseph.bayley/soapcw/-/raw/master/pipeline/images/band_summary.png" />

        Which contains all table columns. The hide track button is used to toggle the viterbi track in the plot. 
        The previous and next buttons cycle through the table in order.

        <img style="width:60%;margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;display:block" src="https://git.ligo.org/joseph.bayley/soapcw/-/raw/master/pipeline/images/plot.png" />

        The plot then contains a number of panels showing information about the band.
        <ul>
        <li> The first panel shows the time-frequency spectrogram from L1 with the viterbi track overlayed </li>
        <li> The second panel shows the time-frequency spectrogram from H1 with the viterbi track overlayed </li>
        <li> The third panel shows the viterbi map from the combination of both detectors, this is related to the probability that a signal is present in any particular time-frequency bin </li>
        <li> The fourth panel shows the normalised SFT power along the red Viterbi track </li>
        <li> The fifth panel shows the mean noise floor across the frequency band as a function of time. </li>
        <ul>
