    "The single-detector algorithm described in previous sections returns the most probable track of the loudest signal assumed to be in Gaussian noise. However, an astrophysical signal is not expected to have an amplitude which is orders of magnitude above the noise floor, but have an amplitude more similar to the noise. Therefore, a signal with a large amplitude is more likely to be of instrumental origin rather than astrophysical.\n"
